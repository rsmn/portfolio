Portfolio
=========

A repo to show people my process of building a portfolio

Stacks
======

I will be working with the following stacks. Each of the stack will be used on the same domain (will be explained in the next section).

1. Laravel API with Sanctum (good ol' session authentication)
2. Next.js (Tailwind) - will consume Laravel API above
3. Go API with JWT auth
4. Next.js (Chakra UI) - will consume Go API above
5. PostgreSQL server
6. React Mapbox
7. PostGIS

Domain
======

In order for me to demo all the stacks, a domain has to be picked. I have decided to tackle the local community management domain.

Essentially these are the main goals of the services:

1. Admin can host events for community members
2. Members can register for events
3. Admin can accept new member registration
4. Admin can manage facilities (community event hall etc)
5. Members can book facility
6. Admin can approve bookings
7. Payments maybe (members need to pay to join. or pay for events, facilities, et cetera)

Tools
=====

I will be mainly using Github to document all my process. I will keep a project specific journal in their own README.md files. For shaping requirements/product discovery, I will be using Github Issues.
